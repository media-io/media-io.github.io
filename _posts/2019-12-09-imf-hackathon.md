The DPP has launched its first hackathon around IMF on the 6th of November ([link](https://www.thedpp.com/tech/versioning/imf-mm-api/hackathon/)).
Its main purpose is the Media Management of IMF content and assets.
  
For this hackathon, Media-IO has contributed to the project named IMF-MM-API, initiated by [Mr MXF](https://mrmxf.com/). It is an open-source project, available on the [DPP repository](https://github.com/thedpp/imf-mm-api).
  
Our contribution has improved the project by providing the following:
- enabled Continuous Integration with Travis - link
- generated Docker container to launch the service easily, available here
- added some filtering options on assets endpoint (f.e. to retrieve only CPLs)
- offered a powerful extension to retrieve linked CPLs: it means that you can search all declined versions from a version (Original Version or any other version).
  
If you would like to test it, feel free to play with our deployed version at [https://imf-mm.media-io.com/api-demo.html](https://imf-mm.media-io.com/api-demo.html)
}
  
Don't hesitate to get in touch if you have any questions, we will gladly answer you.
We once again thank the [DPP](http://thedpp.com) !
